# word-bridge
## based from the roblox game, [Word Bridge](https://www.roblox.com/games/11169441681/Word-Bridge).

honestly, the idea feels like a party game, whether it be for socializing with friends in real life or not, because it's a simple content game idea. (the brightass look makes me even more emphasizing the reason why)

you'll need `python-Levenshtein`, `discord.py`, `python-dotenv`, and also to put the `CHANNEL` and `TOKEN` as environment variables (mostly by using the `.env`)

this bot is supposed to not be shared in multiple servers, but single, and should be supposed to be hosted locally temporary (using your computer).

suggest multiple issues if you wish to have it as a bot in alot of servers and running it alot.
